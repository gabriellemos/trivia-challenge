## Sumary

Implementation of a trivia challenge App made with ReactJS. This app will request 10 questions to a remote server and will represent those questions to the user, one by one. After no questions remaining, a result screen will be displayed where it is possible to check your score and which questions you got it wrong.

## Dependencies

### Configuring Environment

In case you don't have node and npm installed, you can download it directly from [Node Website](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

## Running on your Machine

Once you've installed all dependencies, the following commands will be available.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode. Once the project is ready, a new tab with the address [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) should de opened automaticaly on your default browser.

> The page will reload when you make changes. You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

> The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
